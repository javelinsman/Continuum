# Continuum

Continuum visualizes **estimated trends of workload** of **heterogeneous, hierarchical tasks** with **nearly-zero amount of overheads** for individual or small-group workers lacking enough energy for manual arrangements.
* It **integrates progress(past), remaining works(present), and anticipated schedule(future)** in a single consistent scheme
* It supports rich **default actions and missing value predictions** to minimize operational overheads
* It can be added on any kind of spreadsheet
  * currently works only for Google Spreadsheet
